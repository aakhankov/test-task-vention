Test Task 

Write a hook, that accepts companyId and returns the list of employees of this company. This list is taken from some backend so you can write any url, it doesnâ€™t require that url will work, only code is analyzed. 
Write a component that uses this hook (passes company id to a hook from props for example) and renders list of employess.
Additionaly, this component may have a button that reloads the list of employees forcibly, so hook should provide such a capability. 
Hook should be optimized as much as possible, it should not send a request on rerenders if it is not required (company id was not changed and button was not clicked to reload employees). Better to add some error handlers via try/catch.
